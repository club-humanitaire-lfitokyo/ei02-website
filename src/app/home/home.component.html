    <h2 class="">About us</h2>
    <p>Founded in 2014 by motivated students during a fundraising for Unicef, the Humanitarian Club of the LFIT is a non-profit organisation dedicated to fostering a spirit of compassion and community service among high school students. We engage in a variety of projects aimed at helping locals, children, animals, people outside Japan, and educating and protecting the environment. Members participate in volunteer efforts, educational initiatives, and awareness campaigns to make a positive impact.</p>

    <h2>How to join us</h2>
    <p>Since we are primarily junior and senior year students, we greatly appreciate the help of younger students who have more free time. </p>
    <p>We welcome project suggestions from everyone, and volunteers of all ages are encouraged to join us !</p>
